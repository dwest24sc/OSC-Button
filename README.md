 OSC-Button verson 0.1
# OSC-Button

This is an all day endeavor to learn what a Pi is, how to code in Python
and how to get a simple OSC Command (1 command) sent to a console or a QLAB machine.

Current itteration has lots of hash marks for notes for me.
OSC Commands currently set up for EOS

long term goals will equal more buttons for stop and pause or back
Plus a screen for current cue playback

Ideas being used from various sources.  Including cscashby/pi-showcontrol.
