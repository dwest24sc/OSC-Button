 OSC-Button verson 0.1
# OSC-Button

This is an all weekend endeavor to learn what a Pi is, how to code in Python
and how to get a simple OSC Command (1 command) sent to a console or a QLAB machine.

first itteration has lots of hash marks for notes for me.
OSC Commands currently set up for EOS

second itteration cleaned it up and allows more contacts and gets rid of the needing to be done in order.

third itteration, which is the un numbered one (i blame git hub confusion on that), is the most recet
and does it without extraneous comments from my work in progress.

next hope is a screen for current cue playback display information.

Ideas being used from various sources.  Including cscashby/pi-showcontrol.
