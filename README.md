 OSC-Button verson 0.5
# OSC-Button

This is a chanllenge to myself to learn what a Pi is, how to code in Python
and how to get a simple OSC Command (1 command) sent to a lighting console or a QLAB machine.

Previous itterations have gone from input on contacts only to outputs in OSC.
Added a small 128x64 screen for cue numbers. That works

Current challenge is getting OSC commands (the cue numbers to be exact) to display on the screen.
I can get it to do the display text just fine.  Now it's about getting the UDP data and displaying
some of it.

Previous versions deleted because the latest version is so massive and combines many things into one script.

Ideas being used from various sources.  Including cscashby/pi-showcontrol.
